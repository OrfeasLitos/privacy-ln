  All players need to register in order to use channels. The registration of
  \alice{} works as follows: \alice{} inputs her desired delay and relayDelay
  that will be used for all her future channels. The first denotes how often she
  has to check the blockchain for revoked commitments and the second defines the
  minimum time distance between incoming and outgoing CLTV expiries. \fpaynet{}
  then informs \simulator{}, who sends back a long-lived public key for \alice.
  This key represents \alice's account, from where \fpaynet{} can get coins to
  open new channels on her behalf and to place coins of closed channels. The key
  is sent to \alice{} who moves some initial funds to it and notifies
  \fpaynet{}. She is now registered. The exact logic is found in
  Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:support}, which also contains the actions of \fpaynet{}
  related to corruptions.

  Additionally, the procedure \texttt{checkClosed}() is called after
  \textsc{read}ing from \ledger, with the received state $\Sigma$as input. This
  call happens every time \fpaynet{} \textsc{read}s from \ledger. The formal
  definition of \texttt{checkClosed}() can be found in
  Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func}, along with a discussion of its purpose.

  The process of \alice{} opening a channel with \bob{} is as follows: First
  \alice{} asks \fpaynet{} to open and \fpaynet{} informs \simulator.
  \simulator{} provides the necessary keys and IDs for the new channel to
  \fpaynet. \alice{} asks \fpaynet{} to check if \ledger{} contains the funding
  transaction from \alice's point of view. If it does, \fpaynet{} activates
  \simulator, who in turn returns control to \fpaynet{}. Now \fpaynet{} checks
  that the funding transaction is in the \ledger{} also from \bob's point of
  view and in case it does, it notifies \simulator. \simulator{} then confirms
  that to \fpaynet{} that the channel is open and \fpaynet{} finally stores the
  channel as open. This last exchange is needed to match the real-world
  interaction.

  When instructed to perform a payment, \fpaynet{} simply takes note of the
  message and forwards it to \simulator. It also remembers to inform the payer
  that the payment has been completed when \simulator{} says so. Observe here
  that \fpaynet{} trusts \simulator{} to correctly carry out channel updates.
  While counterintuitive, it allows \fpaynet{} to ignore the details of channel
  updates, signatures, key and transaction handling. Nevertheless, as we will
  see \fpaynet{} keeps track of requested and ostensibly carried out updates and
  ensures that upon channel closure the balances are as expected, therefore
  ensuring funds security.

  Similarly to payment instructions, when \fpaynet{} receives a message
  instructing it to close a channel (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close}), it takes a
  note of the pending closure, it stops serving any more requests for this
  channel and it forwards the request to \simulator. In turn \simulator{}
  notifies \fpaynet{} of a closed channel with the corresponding message, upon
  which \fpaynet{} takes a note to inform the corresponding player. Depending on
  whether the message instructed for a unilateral or a cooperative close,
  \fpaynet{} will either put or not a time limit respectively to the service of
  the request. In particular, in case of cooperative close, the time limit is
  infinity (l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:coop:mark}). As we will see, in case a
  unilateral close request was made and the time limit for servicing it is
  reached, \fpaynet{} halts (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func},
  l.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func:idle}). Once more \fpaynet{} trusts \simulator,
  but later checks that the chain contains the correct transactions with
  \texttt{checkClosed}() (Fig.~\ref{alg:fpaynet:close:func}).
